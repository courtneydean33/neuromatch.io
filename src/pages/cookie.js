      <p>
        In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or

      </p>
      <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
        device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
        efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, University of
        Pennsylvania) are called &quot;first party cookies&quot;. Cookies set by
        parties other than the website owner are called &quot;third party
        cookies&quot;. Third party cookies enable third party features or
        functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like
        advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set
        these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it
        visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other
        websites.
      </p>
      <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
        are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate,
        and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;strictly
        necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and
        target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
        Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for
        advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more
        detail below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
        Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note
        that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific
        Online Properties you visit):
      </p>
      <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
        can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
        Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
        which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
        cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
        on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
        website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
        website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
        controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can
        refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
        browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser&apos;s help menu for
        more information.

      <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
        website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like
        web beacons (sometimes called &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or &quot;clear
        gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
        identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our
        Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for
        example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a
        website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
        understand whether you have come to the website from an online
        advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
        performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.
        In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
        properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
      </p>
      <h3>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h3>
      <p>
        Websites may also use so-called &quot;Flash Cookies&quot; (also known as Local
        Shared Objects or &quot;LSOs&quot;) to, among other things, collect and store
        information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for
        other site operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
        the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using
        the tools contained in the
        <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">
          Website Storage Settings Panel
        </a>
        . You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the
        <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">
          Global Storage Settings Panel
        </a>
        and following the instructions (which may include instructions that
        explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
        &quot;information&quot; on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
        being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
        Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being
        delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
        acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of
        some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used
        in connection with our services or online content.
      </p>
      <h3>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h3>
      <p>
        Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to
        serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use
        information about your visits to this and other websites in order to
        provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be
        interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure
        the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them
        using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to
        this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about
        goods and services of potential interest to you. The information
        collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify
        your name, contact details or other details that directly identify you
        unless you choose to provide these.
      </p>
      <h3>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect,
        for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational,
        legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie
        Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
        technologies.
